      color: "Color grading is not decoration. If it doesnâ€™t enhance mood or clarity, it's visual noise. Oversaturation, muddy midtones, or aimless shifts should be treated as technical debt.",
      focus: "Precision matters. If softness is intentional, it must be narratively justified. If not â€” it's failure masked as aesthetic choice.",
