        "The composition needs a stronger foreground element to anchor the eye and create depth.",
        "You've missed the sweet spot of golden hour by about 20 minutes ‚Äî the light is a bit too harsh on those ridges.",
        "The horizon line is slightly tilted (about 1.5 degrees clockwise). Always check your level!",
        "The shadows are a bit too blocked up ‚Äî try a subtle HDR approach or luminosity masking to recover those details.",
        "The wide angle has created distortion at the edges that's distracting from the majesty of the scene."

      modifications: [
        "Try focusing at the hyperfocal distance (about 1/3 into the scene) with f/11 for edge-to-edge sharpness.",
        "Return during blue hour (20 minutes after sunset) when the sky and landscape are in perfect luminance balance.",
        "A 2-stop soft-edge graduated neutral density filter would balance that bright sky without looking artificial.",
        "A polarizing filter would cut the atmospheric haze and make those clouds pop against a deeper blue sky.",
        "Try a vertical composition to emphasize the height of those formations and create a stronger sense of scale.",
        "Wait for moving clouds to create dynamic light patches on the landscape ‚Äî it transforms a static scene into a story.",
        "Consider focus stacking three images to get tack-sharp details from those foreground rocks all the way to the distant peaks."
